The utils folder will have all the shared logic accross the app, for example 
if one component uses the same logic as other component maybe we should catgorized
it under the same name and folder. lets say:
Function that retrive the name from the request:
    creating file call request.ts, inside it appling the logic of the function.

dont forget to module.export the function from the module.
