Here will create the custom hooks for the app. some key notes.
    1. each hook will have a seperate file
    2. the file name will corospond to the hook name
    3. break the hook to many other function to keep the 'single responsabilty'

    
    
    
lets say we create hook for fetching data:
hook name -> useFetch
file name -> hooks/useFetch.tsx
