The stories folder is used with Storybook to store individual stories 
for components, enabling interactive component development and documentation.

we will keep it simple, any big component for example Dashboard component
will recive a documentation about what funcionality there is, how it should
be visualized, and so one.

name convention
Dashboard component will have Dashboard.story.txt
