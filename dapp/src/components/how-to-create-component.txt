Creating a basic component will include the following:
    1. each component will have a seperate folder.
    2. all the components will be under the folder components
    3. if it shared component (like a button) under the folder
     components/shared/<component_name>/<component_name>.tsx
    otherwise under the folder components/<component_name>/<component_name>.tsx

for example
Button component -> creating folder components/shared/regularBtn.tsx
Dashboard compononent -> creating folder components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx
